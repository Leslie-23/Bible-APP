## How It Works
Whether or not a user is signed in, they can search for and read Bible chapters. If a user is signed in, they can save verses to their list. "Verse-adding mode" is enabled by clicking on any one verse in the chapter and then clicking on the "+" button adjacent to the verse numbers". A user can remove verses from their list via clicking one, and then clicking the "-" button.

## Next Steps
There are several additional functionalities that would improve The MERN Bible's UX and UI:
- Notes attached to saved verses
- Sophisticated/custom error messages
- Page navigation and making modern Bible translations available (Bible SuperSearch would be a limiting factor to making these possible, due to a 1000/day rate limit and some modern translations not being available)
