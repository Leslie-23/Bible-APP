# The MERN Bible
### A King James Version reference powered by [BibleSuperSearch](https://api.biblesupersearch.com/)

## Link to Site
[Heroku](https://mern-bible.herokuapp.com/)

## How It Works
Anyone, whether logged in or not, can look up and read Bible chapters. Logged-in users can save verses to their personal list. This is done by clicking anywhere on a chapter's text, then clicking "+ [verse number]". Verses can be removed from a user's list by clicking "-".

## Logo
The logos and icons were made using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), an open-source SVG editor.

## Next Steps
There are several additional functionalities that would improve The MERN Bible's UX and UI:
- Notes attached to saved verses
- Sophisticated/custom error and confirmation messages
- Page navigation and providing modern Bible translations. (Bible SuperSearch would be a limiting factor to making these possible, due to its 1000/day rate limit and some modern translations not being available. Another Bible API would have to be used.)
